# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
    BAD:

     The visualization is bad because it lacks susbtantive and perceptual.
    
    The bar graph has a title noting that it is the authors first dataset, and it has asthetic because it has colours and the graph is easy to see, but lacks in other areas. 
    
    For example it lacks substantive and is not perceptual, meaning that there is no accuracy and integrity of the data presentation. The title of the graph has a red box beside it, and the first bar is the same shade, therefore its misleading. We are not given how the data was collected, and what each bar represents. It also lacks x and y labels. Although the x-axis notes the months of the year, the y-axis does not indicate what the numbers mean, and how the data was collected. The graph is not perceptual because any user could interpret the graph in multiple ways. Since the title is "my first dataset", the y-axis could be the number of hours worked on the data set per month, or the number of datasets worked on per month. The insights of the graph are not clear. It also lacks Provenance rhetoric, because the graph is not explained. 



    GOOD:

    This is a good visualization because the title clearly indicates what the graph is showing, there is asthetic because there is colour. The colours are also divided by womens sports vs mens sports. Although it lacks an y-axis, it has the miles listed above each graph. The graph is visually appealing because it showes a trend from highest to lowest.

    The graph has substantive and perceptual it gives details on the highest bar, the womens vollyball team as by showing the number of vollyball programs in the country, clearly noting the reason behind that group highest average miles travalled. The information provided is backed up by noting the areas with the highest concentration of vollyball programs. The data visualization also notes a general blurb at the bottom of the graphs, not creating any bias. 



      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
    Bad:
    - needs labels on x and y axis
    - no reproducability because there is not a lot of information provided as no explaination how the data was collected
    - main title needs to change to reflect the data
    - the red box by the main title is misleading and connects the month of january to the title, but gives no indication on the other months, therefore removing that red box would be improve any immdiate bias
    


    Good:
    - using the same sports for both mens and women teams for better comparison, as the visualization has more information on vollyball
    - it is bias, because different sports are used, the miles are indicating that female atheles travel more, therefore is not as ethical
    - 





      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
