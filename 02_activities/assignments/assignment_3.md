# Data Visualization

a## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```

    The visualization is accessible and reproducible and equitable because its using contrasting colours (Purple and Orange) in the bar graph. The bar graph has very good labels, and follows a downwards trend. The graph doesnt just use colour, but also uses the shape and size of the bars to show a downwards trend, and the labels for each bar is easy to ready and identify. The labels and legend are very clear and easy to read. The font size is large and has monospaced text.  The graph is also created using information on NCSA recuiting data and therefore is reproducible. Since the source of the data is linked at the bottom, the access to raw data or detailed data can be used to replicate the diagram. The graph uses men and women athletes showing a diverse group of people and showcases various different sports.

    Bad:

    This data visualization is not accessible, reproducible, equitable because the colors being used are very pale, and there is no contrast between the colours. If converted to black and white, it could be hard to see. The box by the title is the same colour of the first bar, which can show a connection, however if in black and white, it may not be idenitifiable. Also there are no proper labels, y-axis does not have a label, therefore we cannot interpret if the each month (x-axis) is good or bad. There is no legend , or title of what this data represent. The main title "my first dataset" is misleading, because how can one have a first dataset for multiple months? We cannot clearly indicate what this visualization is about. Furthermore, this data not reproducible because there is no source, we cannot get to the raw data to reproduce this visualization, and since it lacks legends and labels, we do not know what each colour represents and therefore this is not equitable. 



        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
    Good:

    This visualization can be imporved because there are other graphs associated with the main bar graph, such as the states and the coloring of the states. It would be hard to see if that part of the visualization was in black and white. The main bar graph has labels but there are no labels for some sports (softball, football, baseball). Identifing those sports would be beneficial for accessibility if colours are not clear to see. Additionally it would be beneficial to see athletes with diverse backgrounds, and a comparision between similar sports because the visulzation showcases different mens and womens sports. Comparing similar sports would increase equitability. Even the USA map, it only focueses on women's travel for vollyball and does not compare the programs avaliable for men's vollyball. The inconsistensy in choosing sports representing the emotional appeal for the data visualization, increasing the subjective interpreations and not present the data without bias. 

    Bad:

    The visualization can be improved by adding more contrasting colours, bigger and clear text (the text is small and blurry). Increase in labels and legends would be good to add. To increase reproducibility more information on how the data was collected, source of the data would be helpful. And equity can be improved but taking samples of multiple people. Looking at this bar graph, it may indicate that the person making the chart is sharing their dataset information, but adding multiple people from different backgrounds will be give better insights. The representation of this visualization is very personal and incomplete as it does not give the user the full information on what the graph shows.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:
